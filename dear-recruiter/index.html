    <h1>Dear Recruiter</h1>
    <p>The following page is my <span class="en-us">CV</span>. It is a web app written in vanilla JS. I chose pure JS because I wanted to learn
      more about it and for the site to be as light as possible. There's also a print-ready version provided below. But
      before you decide what you'd like to see, take look at:</p>

      <h3 class="question">Tell us about a challenging JS/library/software bug you've dealt with.</h3>
      <p class="answer">There's a memory leak in Angular's custom form controls - basically if your component is a
        custom control and gets destroyed, it's not always disconnected from the control object. We had a form control
        that usually was a select but we needed it to sometimes be a text input instead. To get rid of the bug, I
        captured the event that was used to change the control type, made it asynchronous to avoid change detection
        glitches, then replaced the original control object with a new one. If I was to fix it in Angular itself, I'd
        probably put all references to custom control components into a map under unique IDs, capture their destroy
        lifecycle handlers, and disconnect them from the control object.</p>

      <h3 class="question">What tools and techniques do you use to improve code quality?</h3>
      <p class="answer">In my current project we use Gerrit to perform regular code reviews. In a pre-commit hook, we
        use TSLint, Stylelint and Prettier, then Husky runs unit tests. Before I commit my changes, however, I try to
        take a step back and read the code again. I ask myself questions such as: "Is it clear at first glance what this
        variable is used for?", "Is there a more meaningful name for this class?", "Can I extract these `if` blocks into
        separate functions?", or "Do I really need four parameters in this function?". These help me make my code easier
        to understand and use.</p>

      <h3 class="question">Tell us about an engineering solution you've built that you're proud of.</h3>
      <p class="answer">I used to work for a client who heavily depended on SalesForce <strong>*shudder*</strong>. Our
        app's configuration for different markets had been stored in the platform's custom metadata objects, which
        started to be unsustainable - mainly because we'd almost reached its 10 MB (!) total limit - so I designed a new
        system that utilized JSON objects, which were stored in the database. I essentially rebuilt everything related
        to configuration from the ground up and got rid of redundancies in the old system. Following this design, we
        wrote a couple of Java classes that enabled us to add new functionality, user roles, form fields, perform
        migrations, etc. with a couple of lines of code and a single entry in the metadata. Then we built a
        configurator app for the client side so that they could easily make changes without involving the product team.
        We also took this opportunity to rebuild our app's configuration store to work with Promises, since until then
        it was based around app-wide events which were unreliable and clunky at best. It's still being used to this day,
        and we reduced the metadata usage by roughly 50 percentage points.</p>
